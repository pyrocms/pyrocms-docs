# PyroCMS Versions

PyroCMS is in constant active development, so it helps to know a little bit about how PyroCMS is developed from a version number standpoint.

## The Latest Stable Version

The download button on the [home page](http://www.pyrocms.com) will always download the latest stable version. The latest stable release is the last version that the PyroCMS community has tested and stamped out as many bugs as possible in.

## Beta Versions

All development for PyroCMS is done on the PyroCMS [GitHub Page](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms). Git allows for different versions of software to exist via branches, and PyroCMS uses branches to create development versions that you can download and use if you'd like to test out new features.

For instance, during the development of PyroCMS 2.1, PyroCMS 2.1 was on the **2.1/develop** branch. You can choose the branch you want from the branch drop down menu, and download a copy by clicking the .zip button.

### Beta Stability

Beware that beta versions of PyroCMS will almost certainly have some bugs and other problems you run into. To report issues, use GitHub's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/issues). You can report issues and get feedback and confirmation form the developers when the problem has been fixed.
