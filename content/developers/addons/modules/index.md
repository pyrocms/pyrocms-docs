# Module Development

Modules are the largest type of add-on for PyroCMS, and the most flexible. With a module you can have:

* Install/Uninstall functions
* Back end interfaces
* Front-end URIs
* Libraries, helpers, configs, and routes
* A plugin file
* Widgets
* Settings

To get started, check out the docs of basic module structure below. Be aware that some pieces of modules (plugins, widgets, etc.) are documented elsewhere in the developer docs section.
