# Add-on Store Submission Guidelines

When you create a addon that may be useful to other people you can share it on the <a href="/store">Add-on Store</a>. Submitted addons go through a validation process that is perfomed by the development team to make sure everything is polished. It is not a painful process, it basically involves using the addon to make sure it is working properly and not doing anything it should not. If it sells the developer will receive 80% of the proceeds (the payments on a monthly basis). The other 20% goes towards paying the store operating costs and to fund additional development.

To make sure your addon is accepted quickly, please follow the following guidelines.

* Must be version 1.0 or greater
* Description should clearly state what the addon does
* Listing must have at least one screenshot
* Live previews are recommended but not required
* Must include documentation or specify where the documentation is found
* Specify any dependencies (for example: This widget requires a theme with jQuery)

## Additional Guidelines

### Themes

* Should specify which major browsers it has been tested with.
* The downloadable zip must upload and install without errors via PyroCMS' admin panel.
* A live preview is required.

### Modules

* The downloadable zip must upload and install without errors via PyroCMS' admin panel.

All good? Alright, head to the <a href="/store/add/details">Add-on Submission</a> page and fill out all of the relevant details.
