# Store Submission Guidelines

When you create a add-on that is useful to other people you can share it on the [Add-on Store](http://www.pyrocms.com/store). When a add-on is submitted it will be validated by the development team to make sure it is up to scratch. This process is not as tough as getting an iPhone App into the App Store, but we will give it a run through to make sure it is working properly and not doing anything it shouldn't. If it sells the developer will receive 70% of the proceeds (distributed monthly). The other 30% goes towards paying the store operating costs and to fund additional development.

To make sure your add-on is accepted quickly, please follow the following guidelines.

## All Add-ons

* Must be version 1.0 or greater
* Description should clearly state what the add-on does
* Listing must have at least one screenshot
* Live previews are recommended but not required
* Must include documentation or specify where the documentation is found
* Specify any dependencies (for example: This widget requires a theme with jQuery)

## Additional Guidelines
### Themes

* Should specify which major browsers it has been tested with
* The downloadable zip must upload and install without errors via PyroCMS' admin panel.
* A live preview is required

### Modules

* The downloadable zip must upload and install without errors via PyroCMS' admin panel.
