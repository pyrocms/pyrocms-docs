# Using Git

<a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a distributed version control system we use to manage development of PyroCMS itself, but the [repository](http://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/) is publicly available on GitHub for people to use to upgrade their sites easily and to contribute changes. No matter how good any open-source project is, each new developer using the system has the potential to make it better, fix bugs or add new features. You can do this by "forking" the repository and sending a pull request for the team to review.

If you use PyroCMS you do not *need* to understand Git or contribute anything, but if you want to and you have no experience with Git then you might want to read through some of the [Help.GitHub Guides](http://help.github.com/) to get an understanding of how it all works.

Once you are ready to contribute you need to pick your work-flow:

## Creating a fork

Go to out [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/) and click "Fork".

You will be set up with a new repository which is a copy of ours. That means you can work on your copy of our repository without us needing to give you access to anything. You can use the following command to get a copy on your computer in your current directory. Best to put this into htdocs (or somewhere you have a server/domains's document root set).

	git clone git@github.com:yourusername/pyrocms.git -b {{ variables:get_var name="pyrocms_version" }}/develop

Now you can edit away on the source code and everything is tracked. When you commit your work *please* commit carefully and do not send us your config.php or database.php files in the changes.

## Making a Pull Request

To make a pull request, see the [GitHub pull request guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
	
## Pulling PyroCMS Updates

Even if you have a copy of our repository then you are basically taking a snapshot of our repository as it is at the time. If we push new commits you will miss out entirely unless you add us as another remote (this works for either workflow).

	git remote add pyrocms git://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms.git
	git pull pyrocms {{ variables:get_var name="pyrocms_version" }}/develop
	git push origin {{ variables:get_var name="pyrocms_version" }}/develop

That will take any new commits from the main PyroCMS repository and push them to your own repository.

If you start spotting any messages about &quot;CRLF line endings&quot;, make sure you have your [line endings set up correctly](http://help.github.com/dealing-with-lineendings/). If you do not have your line endings set up to use Unix line endings when committed to the server then we will ignore your commits as it will mark pretty much every file as changed and mask your actual changes.
