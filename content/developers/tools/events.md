# Events

Events allow you add your own functionality to the PyroCMS core by hooking into preset points in the code called triggers. There are several triggers already in place in the PyroCMS core that allow you to do things within your code when other parts of PyroCMS run.

## Using Events in your modules

Create an events.php file in the root of your module (it will be autoloaded when PyroCMS starts to run). Below is an example file from a module named "Sample":

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1373989.js?file=gistfile1.aw"></script>

In the above example, the **Events\_Sample** registers the function 'run' to run when the **public\_controller** trigger is called in PyroCMS.

It is important to note that some triggers pass data that you can use in your function as well.

## PyroCMS Triggers

PyroCMS includes the following event triggers:
