## Introduction

PyroCMS provides a simple and powerful API for handling your addon's assets. Typically, Laravel requires you to publish assets before being able to use them. The Asset services let's you refer to your assets in an addons resources directory without the hassle of publishing.
  
PyroCMS will automatically collect, combine, minify, compile with pre-processors and publish the result as needed.
