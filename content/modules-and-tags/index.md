# Tag Reference

Tags are a way to put dynamic content into your theme or page content. They may also be used as a shorthand way to insert an image tag, link to javascript files, etc. They can be embedded in Page content, Blog posts, and directly in a Theme file.

For example, here is a simple tag that returns the site's URL:

	{{ noparse }}{{ url:site }}{{ /noparse }}

Tags can range from variables, like this, to more advanced functionality like displaying blog posts.

It's important to note that some tags accept attributes that affect their output. For example the list of plugins that you see at the top of this page is generated by a plugin within the core of PyroCMS - the {{ link uri="/modules-and-tags/tag-reference/pages" title="Pages" }} plugin, by embedding the page_tree tag:

	{{ noparse }}{{ pages:page_tree start-id=&quot;foo&quot; }}{{ /noparse }}
