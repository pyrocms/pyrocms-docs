# Themes

Themes are PyroCMS's organizational system for front-end assets and code. In a theme you can have:

* Theme layouts
* Theme partials
* CSS
* JS
* Images

<div class="tip"><strong>Note:</strong> for more information on master layouts and theme partials, please see the {{ link uri="concepts/organization" title="PyroCMS organization guide" }}.</div>

Themes can go in your _addons/&lt;site-ref&gt;/themes_ folder or in your _addons/shared\_addons_ folder and are installed via the control panel under **Design &rarr; Themes**.

You can download themes via the [PyroCMS add-on store](http://www.pyrocms.com/store) or create your own. For more information on themeing PyroCMS, see the {{ link uri="theming/custom-theme-basics" title="creating a custom theme" }} guide.
