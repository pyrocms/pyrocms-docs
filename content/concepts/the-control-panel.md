# The Control Panel

The PyroCMS control panel has been completely redesigned for version 2.0 and has a lot of great new features. Here is a basic tour of what you'll find.

## Logging in

To log into your control panel, go to **yoursite.com/admin**. Enter your email address and password, and you should be good to go!

After you've logged in, you'll see the PyroCMS control panel dashboard:

The news feed (which you can change) shows the latest entries from the PyroCMS [blog](http://www.pyrocms.com/blog) &mdash; keep an eye on it to see when a new version is released.

## The CP Menu

Your entire control panel can be accessed from the top black navigation bar.  The items with vary depending on which sections you have access to (you're the administrator? that's everything). It's divided into the following sections:

- **Content:** Modules that deal with your site's content. You can find the pages, widgets, uploaded files and blog modules in here, among others.
- **Design:** Modules concerned with a site's presentation, such as navigation and themes. It also contains your email templates.
- **Users:** Controls for users, groups, and permissions.
- **Utilities:** Here you can find admin utilities like redirects and maintenance.
- **Settings:** This section holds settings for the entire site, from the site name to language preferences.
- **Add-ons:** A list of currently installed core modules, as well as third party modules. You can install and manage third party modules here.
- **Profile:** View your details or change your password.  Plus a link back to the public website.

## Changing the Default Language

PyroCMS comes in many different languages, and to change the language (English, by default), choose a new language from the menu on the right hand side of the footer:
