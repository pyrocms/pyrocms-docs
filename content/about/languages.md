## How PyroCMS Handles Language

PyroCMS is based off of CodeIgniter, which has a built-in language separation function that PyroCMS utilizes. Modules and all core code is built to be multi-lingual, and you can change the admin panel language on the back end via a drop down. Although PyroCMS doesn't make your website multi-linguagal, it is a CMS built with languages in mind.
