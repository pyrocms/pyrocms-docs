# Variables

The _variables_ module you to create variables that are accessible throughout your PyroCMS code. They are a good way to set small bits of text that you or other admins may want to change later. For instance, you can create a variable for the site's official Twitter handle. If it ever changes, it can be easily changable via the variables module. 

## Creating Variables

To create a new variable, go into the Admin Panel, and select *Variables* from the *Data* menu. Click **+ Add Variables** and create a slug and a value for your variable. The slug is what you'll use to refer to the variable in your layouts.

Once variables are created, you can edit them inline by clicking **Edit**.
