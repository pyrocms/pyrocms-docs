## Basics

PyroCMS is a modern CMS built on [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com) using the [Streams Platform](http://streamsplatform.com).


<i class="icon checkmark green"></i> **Modern:** PyroCMS is built on the modern and incredibly popular [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com) framework.

<i class="icon checkmark green"></i> **Transparent:** PyroCMS does not interfere with Laravel's normal behavior but only supplements it.

<i class="icon checkmark green"></i> **Mature:** Though Version 3 is a 100% rewrite, we have been in the CMS business since 2009.

<i class="icon checkmark green"></i> **For everyone:** PyroCMS is engineered to be simple to use for developers, designers and users alike.

<i class="icon checkmark green"></i> **Modular:** PyroCMS is composed of a common core and powerful addons. That's it.

<i class="icon checkmark green"></i> **Standard:** PyroCMS adheres to PSR-1 and PSR-2 style guides and is entirely PSR-0/4 autoloaded.

<i class="icon checkmark green"></i> **OOP:** PyroCMS is entirely OOP in structure.


## History

### PyroCMS Is Born - 2008

PyroCMS was originally developed by [Phil Sturgeon](https://philsturgeon.uk/) in 2008 as a simple, flexible, community driven Content Management System built with the PHP framework CodeIgniter.

The CMS was originally developed for Phil's various personal and commercial freelance projects and over the course of a few years got to be a very useful system for quickly making simple sites. In 2009 this CMS was released open-source under the name PyroCMS, taken from Phil's forum handle at the time "thepyromaniac". It was welcomed by the community and by 2010 it already had an active core development team.

Since those early days PyroCMS has grown rapidly to be translated into more than 22 languages, accepted code from over 200 contributors, has over 12,500 commits and has been installed over 43,000 times since v1.0.

### Streams Philosophy - 2012

In 2012 (Adam Fairholm)[https://twitter.com/adamfairholm] introduced the Streams Module. Streams was a concept that allowed developers to create standardized data structures using a graphic interface. The module was eventually adopted into core as a Pro module and then later abstracted into a core API that shipped with both versions PyroCMS.

Developers instantly fell in love with the concept and it has quickly become a linch pin feature in PyroCMS and a popular philosophy when building addons. You can read more about streams [here](http://docs.local:8888/streams/introduction).

### A Fork In The Road - 2014

In 2014, core developer [Ryan Thompson](https://github.com/ryanthompson) was playing with the idea of an entire open source development platform based on the "idea" of Streams abstracted into a composer package.

A couple months later while in NYC for Laracon Ryan spoke with the other team members about the now maturing "Streams Platform" and the decision was made to restructure the company and it's product with this new vision.

### Today

Today, PyroCMS is powered 100% by Streams and has been entirely rewritten in Laravel 5. Because of it's standardized Streams core and extensive automation, PyroCMS is of the fastest and easiest CMS's to build on.


## Philosophy

PyroCMS takes has historically taken a very different stand on development. Today, that statement is more true than ever.

PyroCMS provides a standardized, simple, and very flexible environment to build in. PyroCMS is designed to do the vast majority of the work by default and allows developers to add detail and override behavior as needed.

The analogy to Lego&copy; bricks is a good example. If you want to build a house with Lego&copy; bricks you do not manufacture your own bricks by hand, then use them to build your house piece by piece from the bottom up in a one-off manner. However most CMS's require you to do just that.

You want to use the best prebuilt walls or even entire houses and modify them to your liking if/as needed. Perhaps tack on a garage too. This will let you build a better house with tried and true components over and over again saving time and money. This is how PyroCMS prefers to handles things.
